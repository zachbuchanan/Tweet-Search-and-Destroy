A personal project to practice Python and the Tweepy library. Feel free to re-use, edit, or do what you will with this code. 

Tweet Search and Destroy will take any keywords you enter, check them against all tweets you have made, and if yany keywords match a word in your tweet, it will permanently remove said tweet. 

Instructions:
1) Turn your twitter handle into a developer account. 
2) Get your access keys via the developer account you created
3) add them to global variables in the code
4) Run program: you will be prompted for your twitter handle and whatever keywords you want to check your tweets against. 

WARNING: ONCE DELETED, YOUR TWEETS WILL NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK.
